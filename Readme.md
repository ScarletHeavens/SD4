Programming for the Web with JavaScript (SD4x) | Penn Engineering Online Learning.

I started this course with a very basic idea about computing and failed miserably. 
Now after 6 months of studies I came back to refactor the code I wrote and complete the course. 
In this course I will be using JS, basic HTML and CSS, jQuery, Node.js and React.
